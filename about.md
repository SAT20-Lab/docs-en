About Us
====

We are a group of technology optimists, a technical team focused on the BTC ecosystem, and we are solely dedicated to protocol development. We do not issue any assets nor have an official community. Any assets issued using the SAT20 protocol are community-driven initiatives. We are willing to provide technical support to the community as long as it aligns with the principles of the SAT20 protocol and falls within our capabilities. We are committed to continuously building the SAT20 ecosystem.
