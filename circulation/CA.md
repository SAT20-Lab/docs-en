Client-side Verification
====

When assets move from layer-1 to layer-2, the most important concern for users is the validity of their assets. Currently, only SAT20 provides the simplest way for users to verify the validity of their assets in their wallets.

Here are the verification methods:

1. By knowing which satoshis are present in the wallet, users can determine what kind of assets are associated with those satoshis. This is the simplest way that anyone can verify and is the unique advantage of satoshi assets.
2. By tracking the transaction history of satoshis within the layer-2 network, users can understand the initial locking position of each satoshi and its transaction history.
3. By monitoring the total amount of satoshis on the layer-2 network, their locking positions, and current positions, users can assess the validity and uniqueness of the satoshis.

Through multiple verification methods, the validity and uniqueness of satoshis on the layer-2 network can be ensured, thereby guaranteeing the validity of assets.
