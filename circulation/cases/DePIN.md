DePIN Network Composed of Old Phones
====

Many old phones from 7-8 years ago already have a quad-core CPU, 2GB or more of RAM, and over 16GB of storage space. These phones are sufficient to serve as lightweight nodes, providing some computational and storage services. Moreover, these old phones consume very little power. If a large number of such phones are connected together to form a network, it can generate economies of scale.

What's remarkable is that the assets of SAT20 are only related to satoshis. Although the number of satoshis is large, the required storage space and computational power are actually minimal. If each person uses an old phone as a lightweight node, it forms a decentralized indexing service network. This network can not only verify one's own assets but also maintain the security of the entire network. Additionally, it can provide storage and computational services, distributed storage of network data, and perform SVM (Satoshi Virtual Machine), thereby earning some service fees.

It is a decentralized BTC asset indexing service network composed of old phones.
