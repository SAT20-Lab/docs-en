Satoshi Virtual Machine
====

The Satoshi Virtual Machine is a virtual execution environment that supports template contracts, WASM (WebAssembly) packages, and runs on an indexer. All code and data originate from the blockchain (mainnet and layer-2 networks) and are executed within the layer-2 network. It operates under user-signed signatures, providing a truly user-centric and secure virtual runtime environment that prioritizes and safeguards user security.
