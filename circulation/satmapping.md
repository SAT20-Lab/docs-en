Satoshi Mapping
====

Satoshis that are locked in Lightning channels are mapped to the layer-2 network and enter the user's wallet in the layer-2 network, where they can circulate within the network.

Users can transfer and transact with their satoshis using wallets in the layer-2 network. Each time a transaction is signed, the Lightning channel state is updated accordingly, ensuring that users can safely exit at any time.
