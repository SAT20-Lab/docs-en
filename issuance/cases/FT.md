Minting FT (Fungible Tokens)
====

Each token is bound to a satoshi. Here are some examples:

The Oriental Peral
----
{   
  "p": "ordx",  
  "op": "deploy",  
  "tick": "Pearl",  
  "block": "828200-828800",  
  "lim": "10000",  
  "des": "The Oriental Pearl."    
}   
Fair minting for this token, which is the first token of the sat20 protocol and a meme coin with no real value, started around February 1st, 2024, and ended around February 5th, 2024 (based on the block heights 828200-828800). Please note that this token is for experimental purposes only, and it is not valuable. Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out).  

We can also mint FT on rare satoshis as part of our planned experiments:

Miner's Jades
----
{  
  "p": "ordx",  
  "op": "deploy",  
  "tick": "Jades",  
  "lim": "1",  
  "attr": "rar=uncommon",  
  "des": "Miner's Jades."  
}  
Only the first satoshi of each block can be successfully minted, and it is estimated that each Jade token will be worth 1 BTC.

Digital Golds
----
{  
  "p": "ordx",  
  "op": "deploy",  
  "tick": "Golds",  
  "lim": "1",  
  "attr": "trz=8",  
  "des": "The first satoshi in a BTC"  
}  
Only the first satoshi of each BTC can be successfully minted. The serial number of this satoshi ends with eight zeros. This means that each token is worth one BTC.
