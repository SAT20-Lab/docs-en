DID
====

Based on the SAT20 Name Service, the following characteristics are achieved for DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers):
1. Uniqueness: Each DID is unique and non-duplicative to ensure the uniqueness of the identifier. The uniqueness of DIDs is supported by the protocol at the underlying level.
2. Decentralization: DIDs are not reliant on central authorities or intermediaries for verification or management. Instead, participants have autonomous control and verification. The individual who holds the satoshi with the corresponding name is the owner of the DID.
3. Verifiability: DIDs have verifiability and can be validated through cryptographic proofs to demonstrate ownership and control. This aligns with the previous point.
4. Persistence: DIDs should have a persistent lifecycle and not be invalidated due to certain changes or expiration. Satoshis are indestructible, and data inscribed on satoshis is also immutable.

In summary, the SAT20 Name Service enables the implementation of DIDs with the characteristics of uniqueness, decentralization, verifiability, and persistence. The nature of satoshis ensures the longevity and immutability of the associated data.
