DeIP
====

DeIP (Decentralized Intellectual Property) is a decentralized network based on BTC that possesses the following fundamental attributes:
1. Decentralization: Creators who submit their works on the BTC network automatically obtain DeIP.
2. Intellectual Property Protection: Similar to open-source software, learning and personal use do not require payment, but commercial usage requires fees.
3. Decentralized Intermediation: DeIP authorization, verification, and management are achieved through smart contracts, distributed ledgers, or other decentralized technologies.
4. Verifiability: Data is inscribed on satoshis, and the individual who holds the satoshi is the owner of the corresponding DeIP.

In simple terms, data recorded on the blockchain automatically becomes a digital asset with intellectual property rights. Commercial usage that generates income using someone else's digital asset requires payment of fees.
