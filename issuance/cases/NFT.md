Minting and Managing NFT Collections
====

Up to this point, the Ordinals protocol has been the most outstanding protocol for issuing NFTs on the BTC mainnet. However, it lacks efficient management for collections. Now, SAT20 inherits the minting capabilities of Ordinals NFTs and enhances the capabilities of NFTs and collection management. Here is a brief overview:

1. Collection Management using Tickers: SAT20 utilizes tickers to manage NFT collections. Each minting result represents a valid minting within that ticker's collection. The indexer provides comprehensive data support for ticker management.

2. Customizable Minting Conditions: SAT20 allows for the customization of minting conditions directly applicable to NFT minting. This enables project owners to set additional conditions for NFT minting. For example, minting can be limited to a specific block height, specify the amount of satoshis included in each NFT, or even set requirements for specific attributes or rare satoshis to be included in the NFT.

3. Possibility for Further Changes to NFTs: Previously, NFTs minted under the Ordinals protocol remained static and unchangeable after minting. However, SAT20 introduces the possibility for further changes and evolution of NFTs. When the underlying satoshis that constitute the NFT undergo changes, the NFT itself can also undergo subsequent transformations.

By incorporating these enhancements, SAT20 improves upon the minting and management of NFT collections, offering greater flexibility and possibilities for customization and evolution of NFTs.
