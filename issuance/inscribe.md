Inscription
====

The technique of writing data on satoshis is called inscription ("inscribe," derived from the Ordinals protocol).

Currently, there are several ways to write data on the BTC mainnet:

1. UTXO: This method is used for data writing in protocols like SRC20.
2. Segregated Witness (SegWit): This method, such as the one used in the Ordinals protocol, involves writing data in the SegWit area.
3. OP_RETURN: This method, as used in protocols like Runes, involves writing data in the OP_RETURN field.

SAT20 supports multiple methods for data inscription on satoshis, with the goal of minimizing any impact on the security of the BTC network. Currently, SAT20 adopts the inscription technology of the Ordinals protocol.

In the future, SAT20 will expand its support for additional data writing methods based on practical needs and circumstances.
